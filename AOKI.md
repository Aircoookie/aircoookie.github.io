## Automated Onboarding Key Infrastructure
*Revision v0.2*

This document describes the **Automated Onboarding Key Infrastructure** (AOKI) and the protocols it defines. Fig. 1 gives a high level overview of the three stages the infrastructure is composed of - Device Initialization, Device Ownership Transfer Authorization, and the actual Zero-Touch Device Onboarding.

### Overview
Automated Onboarding Key Infrastructure (AOKI) is a protocol that simplifies zero-touch onboarding and is currently in a Proof-of-concept phase in the Trustpoint project.
It is inspired by concepts from standardized Zero-Touch protocols BRSKI (RFC 8995) and FIDO FDO, but differs in key aspects.
At the time of device onboarding, AOKI works fully offline, without the need for a connection to an external service like a MASA or a Rendezvous Server.
The only requirement for onboarding to be possible is the Device having a connection to the AOKI Owner Service, which is usually present on the same host as the networks RA functionality for certificate enrollment (e.g. Trustpoint/other EST server) 
The initial method by which the device discovers the AOKI Owner Service is flexible - for local environments, mDNS (Zeroconf) appears like a suitable solution.
AOKI offers mutual trust verification - therefore there are no security implications due to *Trust on First Use*.
The Owner Service verifies the device via a standard IEEE 802.1AR IDevID certificate.
The device verifies the owner by a certificate we call a DevOwnerID, the device trusts the issuer of this certificate (usually the manufacturer).
A DevOwnerID certificate is a standard X.509 certificate with a Subject Alternative Name extension that contains identifiers for all IDevID(s) the DevOwnerID is valid for.
The trust establishment is currently based on mutual TLS with a custom HTTP GET init request, though the team is also drafting an alternative approach working exclusively over CMP. After trust establishment, actual enrollment is handled by standard PKI protocols like EST and CMP.

### Goals
- The implemented solution shall use secure device identities (DevIDs), according to IEEE 802.1AR
- The solution offers automatic mutual authentication (no trust on first use)
    - The network runs an Owner Service that verifies identity using the manufacturer IDevID PKI
    - Device verifies Owner identity using an X.509 certificate called the DevOwnerID (issued by a (manufacturer) CA the device trusts)
-  The solution offers link-local owner service discovery
    -  e. g. multicastDNS
-   The solution should not depend on third parties
-   No dependency on the manufacturer or previous owner at the time of onboarding

### Definitions

The *Device* represents a new entity to be added to a network.

The *Owner Service* is the entity within the network responsible for initial onboarding of new Devices via AOKI. It typically performs the services of a Registration Authority (RA) and it would be a common scenario to host the Owner Service on the same hostname/server as the RA offering PKI services such as an EST server.

### The DevOwnerID
The DevOwnerID is a standard X.509 certificate.

#### Attributes
There are no required fields in the certificate subject Distinguished Name (DN).
It is RECOMMENDED that a the `pseudonym` name attribute with value  `DevOwnerID`is added, this is only intended to simplify distinguishing DevOwnerIDs from other types of certificates. 

> Note: The Serial Number attribute is of type PrintableString, so the character `_` MUST NOT be used. It is RECOMMENDED to replace any spaces or underscores in the manufacturer-defined serial number with a hyphen (`-`).
#### Extensions
The certificate MUST have a `BasicConstraints` extension marked as critical.
Conforming DevOwnerIDs SHOULD be CA certificates to facilitate transfer of device ownership. The `pathLenConstraint` MUST be absent to facilitate an arbitrary amount of device ownership transfers.

The DevOwnerID MUST have a `SubjectAltName` extension that lists the IDevID certificate(s) the DevOwnerID is valid for. Each IDevID is listed as a `UniformResourceIdentifier` (URI) with the fixed format:
`<IDevID_Subj_SN>.dev-owner.<IDevID_x509_SN>.<IDevID_SHA256_Fingerpr>.alt`, where:
- `IDevID_Subj_SN` is the `SerialNumber` name attribute in the IDevID subject DN; or the character `_` (underscore) if this attribute is not present in the IDevID certificate
- `IDevID_x509_SN` is the X.509 Serial Number in lower case hexadecimal notation.
- `IDevID_SHA256_Fingerpr` is the SHA256 fingerprint of the IDevID certificate in lower case hexadecimal notation.

#### Issuer
The DevOwnerID is issued by a CA that is trusted by the device. A reasonable choice is an DevOwnerID Root CA generated exclusively for the DevOwnerID chain corresponding to each given IDevID or set of IDevIDs belonging together. While it appears a straightforward choice, the same CA as for issuing IDevIDs SHOULD NOT be used to issue DevOwnerID certificates, as standard PKI verification tools may verify unauthorized IDevIDs issued by DevOwnerIDs. The only type of certificate a DevOwnerID is allowed to issue is another DevOwnerID with identical or a subset of the IDevID identifiers in its SAN, though it is not yet specified how to best enforce this constraint on the PKI level.

#### Validity
The DevOwnerID SHOULD have a `notValidAfter`equal to the `notValidAfter` of the IDevID that expires last among the ones referenced in the certificate. It is recommended to use a `notValidAfter` of `99991231235959Z`. `notValidBefore`MAY be set to the earliest `notValidBefore` among the referenced IDevID certificates.

## Device Initialization
This stage involves initial provisioning of the Device with an IDevID and associated Owner Truststore. It is not yet specified in detail in this document.

## Device Ownership Transfer Authorization
This stage involves using the initial DevOwnerID (or Root CA) to issue a new DevOwnerID to the new Owner of the Device - for example, if the Device is sold by its manufacturer to a supplier or an operator. It is not yet specified in detail in this document.

## AOKI Zero-Touch Device Onboarding

This stage entails the actual automatic onboarding of the device to the network of the new Owner.

For Zero-Touch Device Onboarding to succeed, the following prerequisites must be met:

|  | AOKI - flexible enrollment protocol | AOKI via CMP
|--|--|--|
| Device Requirements | IDevID, Owner Truststore, TLS client authentication | IDevID, Owner Truststore
| Owner Service Requirements | DevOwnerID, IDevID Truststore, TLS server with client auth support | DevOwnerID, IDevID Truststore, HTTP server


### AOKI Mutual TLS Device Onboarding with flexible enrollment protocol
This AOKI Device Onboarding protocol variant is designed to be agnostic both to the utilized Owner Service discovery method (e.g. mDNS) as well as the protocol used for LDevID/domain credential enrollment. The Owner Service may offer an arbitrary amount of PKI protocols to the device. It is RECOMMENDED to support EST as the enrollment protocol.
The AOKI variant is comprised of an `AokiInitializationRequest` HTTP request from the device to the Owner Service, followed by enrollment via a PKI protocol agreed upon by the Device and Owner Service.
#### Protocol description
The initial step is the automatic discovery of the Owner Service by the Device upon initial connection to the network. This is not defined herein, a suitable candidate for local networks would be mDNS with the service type `_aoki._tcp.`.

The AOKI Initialization Request is an HTTP `GET` request from the Device to the Ownership Service on the endpoint `/aoki/init`.
> Note: Registering the  .well-known URI scheme /.well-known/aoki should be considered.

The Initialization request SHALL be made via TLS with client authentication and the Device MUST use its IDevID as the certificate for TLS client authentication.
As the Device is generally not provisioned with a TLS truststore at this point, it MAY provisionally trust the Owner Service TLS server certificate.

Given a successful TLS handshake, the Owner Service now verifies that it trusts the provided IDevID - for example by means of a Truststore including the IDevID issuer.
Additionally, it checks whether it is in posession of a DevOwnerID certificate valid for this IDevID. If both conditions are met and the Owner Service approves enrollment attempts from this device, it replies with a HTTP 200 OK status and as content a JSON message of the following format:

```json
{
	"aoki-init": {
		"version": "1.0",
		"owner-id-cert": "----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ----- ..."
		"tls-truststore": "----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ----- ..."
		"enrollment-info": {
			"protocols": [
				{
					"protocol":"EST",
					"url":"https://localhost/.well-known/est/domain/domaincredential/"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

#### JSON field descriptions
`version`: The version of the `aoki` protocol used  by the Owner Service. This number follows semantic versioning, i.e. clients SHOULD expect breaking changes only if the major version is increased (`2.x`)
`owner-id-cert`: The DevOwnerID public key certificate corresponding to the Device IDevID, as a PEM-encoded string.
`tls-truststore`: The TLS server certificate(s) the Device can trust for onboarding and enrollment operations, as concatenated PEM-encoded string. The included certificates SHALL include the TLS certificate used by the Owner Service TLS server for this Initialization Request.
`enrollment-info`: Contains information regarding the device enrollment. Currently, only `protocols` is defined, though an Owner Service MAY include additional application-domain specific fields.
`protocols`: A list of objects defining the enrollment PKI protocols supported by the Owner Service. The Device MAY freely choose any of the available protocols. A protocol is defined by an object that contains at leasts  the string `protocol`. Additional protocol-specific fields MAY be added, e.g. `url`.
`protocol`: The name of the enrollment protocol as a string.
`url`: The URL of the enrollment endpoint. REQUIRED for EST and CMP protocols.

#### Signature
After serializing the JSON response, the server signs the content bytes of the response using the DevOwnerID private key. The Base64-encoded signature bytes MUST be included as an `AOKI-Signature` HTTP header. The OID dotted string of the used signature algorithm SHALL be included as the `AOKI-Signature-Algorithm` HTTP header.

#### Failures and errors
If the Owner Service does not wish to accept the device or encounters an error, it SHALL reply with an appropriate HTTP error status of 400 or higher. It MAY include a human-readable representation of the error that occured as content. The `AOKI-Signature` headers MUST NOT be included.

#### Initialization Request response handling by the Device
When the Device receives the response, it SHOULD first ascertain that the response has HTTP status `200 OK` and that the response content is a valid JSON object conforming to the format defined above. Furthermore, it SHALL ensure the `AOKI-Signature` headers are present.

The Device is now expected to verify the provided DevOwnerID from the `owner-id-cert` field against the Owner Truststore the device has been provisioned with. In case the Device has been onboarded before, it is RECOMMENDED the device only accept DevOwnerIDs either equal to or issued by the DevOwnerID used for the previous onboarding process; this is to prevent previous device owners from onboarding the Device without the consent of the current Owner.

Given the Device trusts the provided DevOwnerID, it SHALL verify the provided Owner Signature in the `AOKI-Signature` header matches the received content. If the signature is verified sucessfully, the Device SHOULD parse the `tls-truststore` field and verify the TLS server certificate used by the Owner Service is included in the truststore.
Once the TLS connection is verified, the Device MAY trust the Owner Service and proceed to enrollment via e.g. EST.

### AOKI Zero-Touch Device Onboarding via CMP

> Note: This is only an initial concept and not yet checked for its feasibility or implemented.

It appears possible to achieve the goals of AOKI - particularly mutual authentication using IDevIDs and DevOwnerIDs - within a (lightweight) Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) profile.

Compared to AOKI Mutual TLS Onboarding with flexible enrollment, this offers the advantage of  not relying on mutual TLS support and potentially allows for onboarding in a single request/response cycle. Furthermore, no AOKI-specific HTTP message protocol is required. Disadvantages are all peers having to support the complex profiles defined as part of CMP and no option of using enrollment protocols other than CMP.
An AOKI-specific implementation to verify DevOwnerIDs against an IDevID is still required both for the Device and Owner Service.

This method is based on the CMP Initialization Request (IR) and Initialization Response (IP) message types.
Signature-based message protection MUST be used.
The Device SHALL use the IDevID as the CMP protection certificate for the IR. The IDevID and its chain are included in the `extraCerts` field.
The Owner Service SHALL use the DevOwnerID as the CMP protection certificate for the IP. In the event of successful LDevID issuance, both the chain of the issued certificate and the DevOwnerID certificate with its chain are included in the `extraCerts` field. Custom handling is required to separately extract the DevOwnerID chain and LDevID chains from `extraCerts`, which is unordered MAY contain other certificates unrelated to AOKI onboarding.
